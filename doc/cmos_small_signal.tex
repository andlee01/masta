% Define a custom nmos subcircuit with ports G D S
% 
% \nmos{F}{shift={(0,0)}}{M1}
%
% Argument #1 is the unqiue identifier. In example above #1 = F and ports called GF, DF and SF 
% are created
%
% Arugment #2 is shift={(0,0)} which is applied to the scope and allows transformations 
% and styles to everything inside it. 
% Another example could be rotate=45, yscale=-1 (flip in y-axis)
%
% Argument #3 is the device ID that is printed on edge labels. In this example it is M1
